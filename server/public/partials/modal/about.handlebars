            Zoff (pronounced <b>søff</b>) is a shared (free) YouTube and SoundCloud based radio service, built upon the YouTube and SoundCloud API. It is mainly a web-based service, but there exists a mobile app for voting, adding and skipping in channels. The service is free for all users, with no registration needed.

            The team consists of Kasper Rynning-Tønnesen and Nicolas Almagro Tonne, and the project has been worked on since late 2014.
